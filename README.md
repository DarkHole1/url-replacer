url-replacer
----

Replaces `url(absolute-path)` with `url(relative-path)` and downloads replaced files.

## Usage

`node replacer.js -i input-file -o output-file [-v]`

Where `input-file` is file's name in which needs replace urls, `output-file` is file's name in which needs write text with replaced urls(may be the same with `input-file`) and `-v` is, of course, `--verbose`.
